&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last update. I was too lazy or busy to write. Actually, I have a lot to talk about these days, for example, around Chinese New Year, a video website renren-yingshi was banned by the authority, later on, there were lots of confusing proposal at The Two Sessions, Ministry of Education banned cell-phones for students under college with plaintext, and the xin-jiang cutton issue recently. The heat of discussion has already gone, so I guess I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna write articles about these issues anymore&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
